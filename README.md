# BNV-Driver
A Python 2 Driver for a bank note validator created during my work experience at innovative technology

After creating this software I compiled the files and put them into the bootloader of a raspberry pi. This way the Bank note validator was operational from the moment it was connected to power, mimicing an embedded system

Unfortunately this software cannot be ran without the specific hardware it was designed for, this being an innovative technology bank note validator.
